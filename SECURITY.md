# Security Policy

These scripts are designed to be used on a local machine, with full awareness
of what you are doing.

While I don't intend to create any security vulnerabilities by running these,
you should review any code you run to make sure it won't do anything yuo
aren't expecting.

If you do find a security vulnerability, please create an issue documenting
the vulnerability. If for some reason it is sensitive, please feel free to email
me directly.

The published version of requirements in requirements.txt will be updated by
dependabot from time to time.
